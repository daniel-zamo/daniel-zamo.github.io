## Question

You're asked to perform changes in the Git repository of the Auto-Verifier app:

1. Clone repository `/repositories/auto-verifier` to `/home/candidate/repositories/auto-verifier`.
1. Perform the following steps in the newly cloned directory
1. Find the one of the branches `dev4`, `dev5` and `dev6` in which file `config.yaml` contains `user_registration_level: open`. Merge only that branch into branch main
