## Question

You need to perform OpenSSH server configuration changes on data-002. Users marta and cilla exist on that server and can be used for testing. Passwords are their username and shouldn't be changed. Please go ahead and:

1. Disable `X11Forwarding`
1. Disable `PasswordAuthentication` for everyone but user `marta`
1. Enable Banner with file `/etc/ssh/sshd-banner` for users `marta` and `cilla`

ℹ️ In case of misconfiguration you can still access the instance using `sudo lxc exec data-002 bash`
