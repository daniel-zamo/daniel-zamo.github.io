## Question

Someone overheard that you're a Containerisation Specialist, so the following should be easy for you! Please:

1. Stop the Docker container named `frontend_v1`
1. Gather information from Docker container named `frontend_v2`:
   
  - Write its assigned ip address into `/opt/course/11/ip-address`
  - It has one volume mount. Write the volume mount destination directory into `/opt/course/11/mount-destination`

1. Start a new detached Docker container:
   
  - Name: `frontend_v3`
  - Image: `nginx:alpine`
  - Memory limit: `30m` (30 Megabytes)
  - TCP Port map: `1234/host` => `80/container`
