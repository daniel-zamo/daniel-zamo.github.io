## Question

On server `web-srv1` there are two log files that need to be worked with:

1. File `/var/log-collector/003/nginx.log`: extract all log lines where URLs start with `/app/user` and that were accessed by browser identity `hacker-bot/1.2`. Write only those lines into `/var/log-collector/003/nginx.log.extracted`
1. File `/var/log-collector/003/server.log`: replace all lines starting with `container.web`, ending with `24h` and that have the word Running anywhere in-between with: `SENSITIVE LINE REMOVED`
