## Question

There was a security alert which you need to follow up on. On server web-srv1 there are three processes: `collector1`, `collector2`, and `collector3`. It was alerted that any of these might run periodically the per custom policy forbidden syscall kill.

End the process and remove the executable for those where this is true.

ℹ️ You can use `strace -p PID`
