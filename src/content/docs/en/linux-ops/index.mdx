Welcome to the **Linux Operations** technical documentation hub. This section consolidates engineering practices for the design, deployment, and maintenance of Linux kernel-based infrastructure.

Content is aligned with industry standards (**LFCS**, **RHCSA**), focusing on practical execution and incident resolution in production environments.

:::tip[Operational Focus]
Documentation prioritizes **CLI (Command Line Interface)** over graphical tools, ensuring management capabilities in *headless* servers and automated environments.
