This section hosts the **practical execution layer** of the portfolio. Each entry is structured as a **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**, simulating real-world infrastructure tickets requiring configuration, troubleshooting, and validation in a live environment.

The objective is to demonstrate resolution capabilities under technical constraints aligned with industry standards (LFCS/RHCSA).

## 🏗️ Environment Topology (Standard Operating Environment)

All scenarios run on a standardized 7-node cluster. This topology simulates a three-tier architecture (Web, App, Data) with nested virtualization capabilities.

:::danger[Access & Security Protocols]
*   **Bastion:** All operations originate from the `terminal` node.
*   **Nested SSH:** Strictly forbidden by security policy. Connections must be direct from the controller.
*   **Persistence:** All configurations must survive a system reboot (*Reboot-proof*).

### Node Inventory

| Role | Hostname | Function / Business Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Management** | `terminal` | Operations Controller (Bastion Host) and main CLI. |
| **Web Tier** | `web-srv1` | SSL Termination, Reverse Proxy, and HTTP Server. |
| **App Tier** | `app-srv1` | Business logic execution and internal APIs. |
| **Data Tier** | `data-001/002` | Persistence, databases, and raw block storage. |
| **Virtualization** | `kvm-001` | Libvirt hypervisor for server consolidation. |
| **Containers** | `docker-001` | Runtime for microservices and lightweight orchestration. |
