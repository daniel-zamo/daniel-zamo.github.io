## 📋 Scenario Requirements

**Context:** A storage consolidation request requires decommissioning physical disk `/dev/vdh` from `vol1` to repurpose it for a new dedicated volume group, without disrupting data integrity.

**Procedure Scope:**
1.  **Hot Migration:** Evacuate data from physical extents (PE) using `pvmove`.
2.  **Topology Change:** Reduce existing VG and initialize `vol2`.
3.  **Provisioning:** Allocate logical storage and apply `ext4` filesystem.
4.  **Format:** Initialize the new Logical Volume with the **ext4** filesystem.

:::caution[Data Safety]
In a real environment, removing a disk from a Volume Group requires ensuring no data physically resides on that specific disk. This scenario assumes you know how to migrate data if necessary.

## 🔧 Solution Walkthrough

<Steps>

1.  **Analyze current storage topology**

    Identify the physical volumes (PV) associated with `vol1` to confirm `/dev/vdh` is part of it.

    ```bash
    sudo pvs
    sudo vgs
    ```
    *Output should confirm `vol1` includes `/dev/vdh`.*

2.  **Prepare the disk for removal (Data Migration)**

    Before removing a physical volume, ensure it is empty. The `pvmove` command relocates any allocated physical extents (PE) from `/dev/vdh` to other free disks within the same Volume Group.

    ```bash
    # Check if the disk is used
    sudo pvdisplay -m /dev/vdh

    # Move data to other disks in vol1 (Best Practice)
    sudo pvmove /dev/vdh
    ```

3.  **Reduce the Volume Group**

    Once the disk is free of data, remove it from the volume group definition.

    ```bash
    sudo vgreduce vol1 /dev/vdh
    ```
    *The disk `/dev/vdh` is now an unallocated Physical Volume (or a raw disk, depending on LVM metadata).*

4.  **Create the new Volume Group**

    Initialize the new group `vol2` using the reclaimed disk. If LVM warns about existing signatures, confirm with `y`.

    ```bash
    sudo vgcreate vol2 /dev/vdh
    ```

5.  **Create the Logical Volume**

    Provision the requested volume. Note the use of `-n` for name and `-L` for fixed size.

    ```bash
    sudo lvcreate -n p1 -L 50M vol2
    ```

6.  **Apply Filesystem**

    Format the new block device with ext4.

    ```bash
    sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vol2/p1
    ```

7.  **Verification**

    Validate the final state. `vol1` should be smaller, `vol2` should exist with the new LV, and the filesystem should be detected.

    ```bash
    # Check VGs and LVs
    sudo vgs
    sudo lvs

    # Verify filesystem type
    lsblk -f /dev/vol2/p1
    ```

</Steps>

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

*   **Error: "Physical volume is still in use"**:
    This happens during `vgreduce` if you skipped step 2. You **must** run `pvmove /dev/vdh` to evacuate data to other disks in the group. If there is no space left on other disks, you cannot reduce the group.

*   **Error: "Device /dev/vdh not found"**:
    Check if the disk exists using `lsblk`. In some lab environments, device names might shift (e.g., `vdb`, `vdc`). Always verify the device name before running commands.
