This document defines the official taxonomy for the knowledge base. Every technical entry on this site must be classified according to its operational impact.

## 🏷️ Content Classification

We classify information using semantic labels to facilitate decision-making during an incident.

### 🔵 SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
Routine and preventive procedures. Their goal is **standardization**.
*   *Example:* [WSL Instance Backup](/en/tech-notes/howto/wsl-export-guide/)

### 🔴 DR (Disaster Recovery)
Emergency protocols for service restoration. Their goal is **continuity**.
*   *Example:* [WSL Environment Restoration](/en/tech-notes/howto/wsl-restoration-guide/)

### 🟡 TRB (Troubleshooting)
Root cause analysis and solutions to specific errors. Their goal is **resolution**.
