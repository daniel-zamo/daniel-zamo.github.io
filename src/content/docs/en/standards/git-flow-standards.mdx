Code traceability is as important as the code itself. This project follows the **Conventional Commits** standard and utilizes **GitHub CLI** for integration management.

## 📝 Commit Semantics

We follow the format: `type(scope): description`.

*   `feat`: New functionality (or new technical note).
*   `fix`: Bug fixes in code or documentation.
*   `docs`: Documentation-only changes.
*   `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependency updates).

## 🚀 Integration Workflow (gh CLI)

To maintain the quality of the `main` branch, direct pushes are prohibited. Every change must follow this cycle:

<Steps>

1.  **Create Branch:** `git checkout -b feature/short-name`
2.  **Semantic Commit:** `git commit -m "feat(scope): description"`
3.  **Push Upstream:** `git push -u origin HEAD`
4.  **Create PR:** 
    ```bash
    gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
    ```
5.  **Merge and Cleanup:**
    ```bash
    gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
    ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
Always check the status of GitHub Actions with `gh pr status` before performing a merge.
