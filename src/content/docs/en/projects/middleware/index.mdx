## Overview

Middleware automation projects focus on eliminating manual deployment processes for enterprise application servers. These implementations demonstrate how to transition from traditional bare-metal installations to containerized, automated deployments.

### Business Context

In Banking and Telco sectors, application servers (JBoss, WildFly, WebSphere) are critical infrastructure components. Manual configuration leads to:

- ❌ **Configuration Drift:** Inconsistencies between environments
- ❌ **Security Gaps:** Missed patches and misconfigurations
- ❌ **Slow Deployments:** Hours/days instead of minutes
- ❌ **Knowledge Silos:** Dependency on specific engineers

**Solution:** Infrastructure as Code + Containerization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose | Why It's Used |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------------|
| **Ansible** | Configuration Management | Idempotent, agentless, SSH-based |
| **Docker** | Containerization | Immutable infrastructure, consistent environments |
| **WildFly/JBoss** | Application Server | Java EE runtime for enterprise apps |
| **GitLab CI** | Pipeline Automation | Continuous deployment integration |
| **Systemd** | Service Management | Native Linux service orchestration |

## 📚 Skills Demonstrated

- **Ansible Playbooks:** Writing idempotent automation tasks
- **Docker Images:** Building production-grade containers
- **Environment Management:** Handling secrets and configuration injection
- **Networking:** Container port mapping and host exposure
- **Documentation:** Technical writing for operational teams

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Explore the WildFly project** to see a complete implementation
2. **Review the source code** (available on GitLab)
3. **Test the playbook** in your own lab environment

:::note[Lab Environment]
All middleware projects can be tested in the LFCS lab topology. The `docker-001` node is pre-configured with Docker runtime.
