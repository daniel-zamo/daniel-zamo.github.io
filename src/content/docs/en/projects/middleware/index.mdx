## Architectural Vision

This section documents the **modernization of middleware platforms**. The goal is to transition monolithic, manual infrastructures toward elastic, code-managed architectures.

### The Business Problem

In regulated sectors (Banking, Insurance, Telco), traditional management of application servers (JBoss, WildFly, WebSphere) introduces critical friction:

*   **Operational Risk:** Manual configuration leads to human error and Environment Drift.
*   **Maintenance Cost:** Excessive time spent on manual patching and updates (Toil) hinders innovation.
*   **Slow Recovery:** High RTOs (Recovery Time Objectives) due to the lack of automated provisioning.

**Implemented Solution:** Immutable Infrastructure + Orchestration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Function | Technical Justification |
|:-----------|:--------|:----------------------|
| **Ansible** | Configuration | Agentless model ideal for environments with strict security constraints. |
| **Docker** | Runtime | Process isolation and portability of binaries and dependencies. |
| **WildFly/JBoss** | Middleware | De facto standard for Java EE applications in Enterprise environments. |
| **Systemd** | Supervision | Native service lifecycle management on the Linux host. |

## 🎯 Key Competencies

*   **Automation Engineering:** Development of idempotent Playbooks and reusable roles.
*   **Secret Management:** Decoupling credentials and configuration from source code.
*   **Container Networking:** Secure service exposure and network interface management.
