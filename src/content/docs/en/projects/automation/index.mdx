## Engineering Vision

This section documents the transition towards **Autonomous Operations**. The focus is not merely on automating tasks, but on building self-correcting systems and knowledge management frameworks through the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and asynchronous orchestrators.

### Strategy Pillars

*   **Toil Reduction:** Systematic elimination of manual, repetitive operational tasks.
*   **Platform Intelligence:** AI integration for technical auditing and automated decision-making.
*   **Scalability:** Workflows designed to be infrastructure-agnostic and highly portable.
