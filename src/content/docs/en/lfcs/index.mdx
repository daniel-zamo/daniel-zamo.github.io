Welcome to the **Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin (LFCS)** knowledge hub. This section is structured to validate your ability to design, install, configure, and manage system installation on Linux.

:::tip[Exam Focus]
The LFCS is a **performance-based exam**. You will not answer multiple-choice questions; you will execute commands in a live terminal. Muscle memory is key.
