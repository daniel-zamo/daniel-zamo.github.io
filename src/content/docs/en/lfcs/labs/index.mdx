This section hosts the **practical validation layer** of this portfolio. Each scenario simulates a real-world infrastructure ticket, requiring the execution of configuration, troubleshooting, and deployment tasks within a live environment.

The objective is to demonstrate muscle memory and architectural understanding under constraints typical of the **LFCS** performance-based exam.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Topology

All scenarios defined in this catalog operate within a standardized **7-node cluster**.

:::danger[Operational Constraints]
*   **Entry Point:** All tasks originate from the `terminal` node.
*   **Connectivity:** **Nested SSH is strictly forbidden**. You must connect to target nodes directly from the main terminal.
*   **Persistence:** All configurations must survive a system reboot.
:::

### Node Inventory

| Role | Hostname | Function / Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Management** | `terminal` | Default controller and CLI entry point. |
| **Web Tier** | `web-srv1` | HTTP serving, Nginx/Apache configuration. |
| **App Tier** | `app-srv1` | Application logic and proxy targets. |
| **Data Tier** | `data-001`, `002` | Database simulation and raw storage. |
| **Virtualization** | `kvm-001` | Libvirt/KVM hypervisor host. |
| **Containers** | `docker-001` | Container runtime host. |
