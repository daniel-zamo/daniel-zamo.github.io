Welcome to my personal study series for the **Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)** certification! I started this journey to validate my skills, share my notes, and refresh my knowledge of professional-level Linux system administration.

In this kickoff post, I'll break down what the LFCS certification is, why it has become an industry standard, and present the roadmap I'll be following to approach exam day with confidence.

## What is the LFCS Certification?

The **Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)** is a prestigious certification that validates your ability to perform intermediate-level system administration tasks on Linux systems. Unlike many multiple-choice theory exams, the LFCS is a **performance-based exam**.

This means you will be placed in a command-line interface on a live environment and required to solve problems and execute tasks just as you would in your day-to-day job as a sysadmin.

> [!NOTE]
> **What does "Performance-Based" mean?**
> You won't be asked "what is the command for...". Instead, you'll be told: "Create a user named `demo`, add them to the `developers` group, and set their default shell to `/bin/bash`." You must execute the necessary commands to achieve the result. It's a true test of real-world skills!

This certification is designed to demonstrate that you have the expertise required for overall operational support of Linux systems and services.

## Why Pursue the LFCS Certification?

In a competitive job market, just having "Linux" on your resume isn't always enough. A certification like the LFCS sets you apart for several key reasons:

	<Card title="Instant Credibility" icon="approve-check-circle">
		It's backed by **The Linux Foundation**, the non-profit organization driving innovation through open source. Recruiters and companies trust its rigor.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Practical Validation" icon="laptop-code">
		It proves you not only know the theory but can **apply it under pressure** in real-world scenarios. This is invaluable to any employer.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Career Boost" icon="rocket">
		It opens doors to better job opportunities and salaries by positioning you as a serious and competent professional in Linux administration.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Who is this Certification For?

The LFCS exam is aimed at candidates who already have some experience with Linux. It is not intended for absolute beginners. Ideally, you should feel comfortable on the command line and have prior experience, either through courses (like the Linux Foundation's own LFS201) or self-study.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you're just starting out with Linux and commands like `ls`, `cd`, or `mkdir` are new to you, it's highly recommended to get comfortable with the fundamentals before tackling this certification path.

## The Exam Domains: Our Roadmap

The LFCS exam is divided into several domains, each with a specific weight in the final score. Throughout this series, we will cover each of them in depth. This will be our roadmap:

1.  **Essential Commands (25%)**
    *   File management, command-line operations, text processing with `grep` and regular expressions, and much more.
2.  **Operation of Running Systems (20%)**
    *   Booting and rebooting systems, managing processes, scheduling tasks (cron), and configuring system logging.
3.  **User and Group Management (10%)**
    *   Creating, modifying, and deleting users and groups. Managing file permissions and ownership.
4.  **Networking (12%)**
    *   Configuring network addresses, managing name resolution (DNS), and setting up the host firewall.
5.  **Service Configuration (7%)**
    *   Basic configuration of essential services like SSHD, chrony, and other network services.
6.  **Storage Management (13%)**
    *   Partitioning disks, creating and managing filesystems (e.g., ext4, xfs), and handling logical volumes (LVM).
7.  **Virtualization & Containers (13%)**
    *   Creating and managing virtual machines and containers.
