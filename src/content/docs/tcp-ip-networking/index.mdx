## What is TCP/IP?

**Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)** is the standard set of communication protocols that enables device interconnection in local networks and on the Internet. This four-layer model (Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access) provides the foundation for virtually all modern network communications.

### Key concepts we'll explore:

- **IP Addressing**: Assignment and management of IPv4 addresses across different network segments
- **Subnetting**: Techniques for dividing large networks into smaller, manageable subnets
- **Routing**: Route configuration between different network segments
- **Switching**: Switch operation in Local Area Networks (LANs)
- **Network Protocols**: DHCP, DNS, ARP, and other essential network services

This section combines fundamental theory with intensive practice, using simulation tools to create a realistic learning environment applicable to the professional world.
