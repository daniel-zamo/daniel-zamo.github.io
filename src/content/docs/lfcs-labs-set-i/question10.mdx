## Question

In this task it's required to access remote filesystems over network.

On your main server terminal use SSHFS to mount directory `/data-export` from server `app-srv1` to `/app-srv1/data-export`. The mount should be `read-write` and option `allow_other` should be enabled.

The NFS service has been installed on your main server terminal. Directory `/nfs/share` should be read-only accessible from `192.168.10.0/24`. On `app-srv1`, mount the NFS share `/nfs/share` to `/nfs/terminal/share`.
