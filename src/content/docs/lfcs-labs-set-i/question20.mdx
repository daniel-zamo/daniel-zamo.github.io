## Question

User Jackie caused an issue with her account on server `web-srv1`. She did run a program which created too many subprocesses for the server to handle. A coworker of yours already solved it temporarily and limited the number of processes user `jackie` can run.

For this the coworker added a command into `.bashrc` in the home directory of `jackie`. But the command just sets the soft limit and not the hard limit. Jackie's password is brown in case needed.

Configure the number-of-processes limitation as a hard limit for user `jackie`. Use the same number currently set as a soft limit for that user. Do it in the proper way, not via `.bashrc`.

On the same server you should enforce that group operators can only ever log in once at the same time, use maxlogins for this.

ℹ️ It's not possible to test/verify the maxlogins after configuration due to how the server has been configured
