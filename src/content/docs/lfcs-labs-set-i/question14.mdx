## Question

On server app-srv1 there is a program `/bin/output-generator` which, who would've guessed, generates some output. It'll always generate the very same output for every run:

1. Run it and redirect all stdout into `/var/output-generator/1.out`
1. Run it and redirect all stderr into `/var/output-generator/2.out`
1. Run it and redirect all stdout and stderr into `/var/output-generator/3.out`
1. Run it and write the exit code number into `/var/output-generator/4.out`
