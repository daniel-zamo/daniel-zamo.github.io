# 🇬🇧 Introduction to `ulimit` in Linux

The `ulimit` command is a core tool for Linux administrators. It lets you set and inspect per-user and per-session resource limits.

- **Soft limit**: enforced value at process start; users may raise it up to the hard limit.
- **Hard limit**: absolute ceiling; only root can raise it. Regular users can lower it.

### Check current limits

```bash
ulimit -a
```

### Temporary session limits

```bash
ulimit -n 4096
ulimit -u 2048
```

Attempting to increase beyond the hard limit will fail with "Operation not permitted".

### Permanent limits (PAM)

Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` or create `/etc/security/limits.d/<user>.conf`:

```
pascual soft nofile 4096
pascual hard nofile 8192
```

### systemd-managed services

Use unit directives:

```ini
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=8192
LimitNPROC=4096
```

Reload systemd and restart the service.

### Notes

- Root can change hard limits; regular users cannot raise hard limits.  
- Use `/proc/<PID>/limits` to verify the effective limits applied to a running process.
