✅ **LFCS Tip**: If `ulimit` doesn't apply, check:

- You're trying to exceed the hard limit without being root.
- The process was launched by `systemd` (check the unit).
- You're in a non-PAM container (use `--ulimit` when creating the container).
- The change was made in a different session (re-log or restart the service).
