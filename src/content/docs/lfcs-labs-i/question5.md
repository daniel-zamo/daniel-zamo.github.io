## Question

{{< alert color="primary" >}}
There is archive `/imports/import001.tar.bz2` on server `data-001`. You're asked to create a new gzip compressed archive with its raw contents.

Store the new archive under `/imports/import001.tar.gz`. Compression should be the best possible, using gzip.

To make sure both archives contain the same files, write a list of their sorted contents into `/imports/import001.tar.bz2_list` and `/imports/import001.tar.gz_list`.

ℹ️ Do not modify or delete the original archive `import001.tar.bz2`
