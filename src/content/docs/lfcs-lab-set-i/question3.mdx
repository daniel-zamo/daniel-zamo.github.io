## Question

<Aside type="note" title="Task Requirements | Time synchronisation Configuration">

Time synchronisation configuration needs to be updated:

1. Set `0.pool.ntp.org` and `1.pool.ntp.org` as main NTP servers
2. Set `ntp.ubuntu.com` and `0.debian.pool.ntp.org` as fallback NTP servers
3. The maximum poll interval should be `1000` seconds and the connection retry `20` seconds

### Answer

#### 1. Analyzing NTP Configuration Scenarios for LFCS

<details>
<summary>Click to see the eduction analysis</summary>

As an experienced Linux sysadmin, when faced with a time synchronization scenario like the one described for the LFCS exam, my first step is always to identify **which NTP service is currently installed and active** on the system. This is crucial because the configuration methods differ significantly between them.

##### ⏰ Common NTP Services in Linux

<details>
<summary>Click to see</summary>

You'll typically encounter one of these services:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="systemd-timesyncd">
    *   **Description**: This is a lightweight NTP client, often the default for modern systemd-based distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, recent Debian). It's designed for simple time synchronization with external servers.
    *   **Use Case**: Ideal when the system only needs to set its own clock and not serve time to others.
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="NTP (ntpd)">
    *   **Description**: The "classic" and full-featured NTP daemon. It's robust and can act as both a client and a server.
    *   **Use Case**: Suitable for complex scenarios, including serving time to a local network, or when very high precision and detailed logging are required.
</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Chrony (chronyd)">
    *   **Description**: A modern alternative to `ntpd`, known for its efficiency and better performance in environments with intermittent network connectivity or virtual machines that suspend/hibernate. It's the default in RHEL/CentOS 8+ and increasingly popular elsewhere.
    *   **Use Case**: Excellent for most modern deployments, especially for clients that need accurate time without the overhead of `ntpd`, or in cloud/virtualized environments.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### 🤔 How to Determine the Active NTP Service

<details>
<summary>Click to see</summary>

Here's my systematic approach to figure out which service is in use:

**Step 1: Check `systemd-timesyncd` Status**

If the system uses `systemd`, this is a quick first check.

```bash
timedatectl status
```
*   **Indication**: Look for `NTP service: active` and `NTP synchronized: yes`.
*   **Deduction**: If it's active, `systemd-timesyncd` is likely handling time. If it shows `inactive` or a similar state, another service is probably in charge.

**Step 2: Look for `chronyd` or `ntpd` Processes**

Search for the running daemons.

```bash
ps aux | grep -E "chrony|ntp"
```
Or more directly:
```bash
pgrep chronyd
pgrep ntpd
```
*   **Indication**: If either command returns a process ID, that service is running.

**Step 3: Verify Service Status with `systemctl`**
Confirm if the services are active and enabled.

```bash
systemctl status chrony
systemctl status ntp
```
*   **Indication**: Check the `Active:` line. It will tell you if the service is running, and if it's enabled to start on boot.

**Step 4: Inspect Common Configuration Files**
The presence and content of these files are strong clues.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Chrony">
    ```bash
    cat /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="NTPD">
    ```bash
    cat /etc/ntp.conf
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="systemd-timesyncd">
    ```bash
    cat /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

*   **Indication**: Finding a configuration file for one service (and not the others) is a strong hint about which one is active.
