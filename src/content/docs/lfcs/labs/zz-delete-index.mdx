## Instructions

- You have access to 7 servers:

  1. terminal (default)
  1. web-server01
  1. app-server1
  1. data-node01
  1. data-node02
  1. docker-001
  1. kvm-001

- The server on which to solve a question is mentioned in the question text. If no server is mentioned, you must solve it on the **default terminal**.
- If you are asked to create solution files at `/<PATH>/.../*`, you must always do this from your **main terminal** (the one you are currently connected to).
- You can connect to each server using SSH, for example: `ssh web-server01`
- All server addresses are configured in the `/etc/hosts` file on each machine.
- **Nested SSH is not possible:** you can only connect to each server directly from the main terminal.
- This workshop does not cover all topics for the LFCS exam.
