Using the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** allows infrastructure engineers to manage the lifecycle of their changes without leaving the terminal, reducing context switching and facilitating process automation.

## 🔄 Terminal-Based Workflow

Unlike the traditional workflow that requires opening a browser, `gh` centralizes interaction with the GitHub API directly in the shell.

## 🚀 Implementation and Setup

Follow this procedure to standardize CLI usage in Linux or WSL environments.

<Steps>

1.  **Binary Installation**
    
    On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh -y
    ```

2.  **Session Authentication**
    
    Link your GitHub account using the secure protocol.
    ```bash
    gh auth login
    ```
    *Select `GitHub.com` > `HTTPS` > `Login with a web browser` and follow the prompt.*

3.  **Pull Request Operational Cycle**
    
    Once commits are made in your feature branch (`feature/*`):

    ```bash
    # 1. Push branch to origin
    git push -u origin feature/branch-name

    # 2. Create the PR with metadata
    gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body "Technical explanation"

    # 3. Validate integration status (CI/CD)
    gh pr status

    # 4. Merge and clean up the branch
    gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
    ```

</Steps>

## 🔍 Operational Advantages

<Aside type="tip" title="DevOps Context">
By using the CLI, you can integrate these commands into your CI/CD scripts or create aliases for rapid deployments. Traceability is identical to the web interface.

| Action | CLI Command | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Checkouts** | `gh pr checkout <id>` | Downloads a colleague's branch for instant local review. |
| **Monitoring** | `gh run watch` | Monitors GitHub Actions progress in real-time. |
| **Diff** | `gh pr diff` | Reviews changes line-by-line in the terminal. |
