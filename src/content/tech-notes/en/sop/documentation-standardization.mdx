In a **SysAdmin & DevOps** environment, documentation quality determines the speed of incident response. This site uses a semantic categorization system to differentiate the type of intervention required.

## 🏷️ Content Taxonomy

We use specific badges to classify the criticality level and purpose of each technical note.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard 
    title="SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)" 
    description="Preventive and routine procedures to maintain system health."
    href="#preventive-sop"

  <LinkCard 
    title="DR (Disaster Recovery)" 
    description="Emergency reactive protocols to restore failed services."

  />
</CardGrid>

### Technical Definitions

| Acronym | Meaning | Practical Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SOP** | Standard Operating Procedure | Installations, scheduled backups, hardening. |
| **DR** | Disaster Recovery | Restoration after data loss, emergency migration. |
| **TRB** | Troubleshooting | Resolution of specific errors or detected bugs. |
| **LAB** | Laboratory | Proof of Concepts (PoC) and experimental environments. |

## 🛠️ Choosing the Right Framework

To maintain consistency, every new note on this site must follow this decision workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Technical Note] --> B{Is it routine?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Classify as SOP]
    B -- No --> D{Is the service down?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Classify as DR]
    D -- No --> F{Is it a specific error?}
    F -- Yes --> G[Classify as Troubleshooting]
    F -- No --> H[Classify as QuickRef/Lab]
    
    style E fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
    style C fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff

## 🚀 Implementation on this Site

You can see these standards applied in the following WSL series guides:

<Steps>

1.  **Preventive Phase (SOP):**
    Generating consistent file system backups.
    <LinkCard 
      title="View SOP: WSL Export" 
      href="/en/tech-notes/howto/wsl-export-guide/" 
      icon="save"
    />

2.  **Recovery Phase (DR):**
    Restoring the environment after migration or system failure.
    <LinkCard 
      title="View DR: WSL Restoration" 
      href="/en/tech-notes/howto/wsl-restoration-guide/" 
      icon="refresh"
    />

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="Continuous Improvement">
A well-executed **SOP** reduces the probability of having to execute a **DR**. Automation (IaC) is the bridge between both categories.
</Aside>
