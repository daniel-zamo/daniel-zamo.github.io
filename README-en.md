## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository hosts my personal **Knowledge Base and Engineering Portfolio**. It serves as a centralized hub for validated technical scenarios, focusing on Linux systems, Virtualization, and Cloud Infrastructure.

The content is structured to demonstrate competency in **LFCS (Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin)** domains and real-world DevOps practices.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

This site is built using a modern **Docs-as-Code** approach:

* **Engine:** [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) (SSG) for high performance and accessibility.
* **Content:** Written in **MDX** (Markdown + Components), migrated and curated from a private Obsidian PKM vault.
* **Deploy:** Automated builds via **GitHub Actions** to GitHub Pages.
* **Styling:** Custom CSS variables adapting to system color schemes (Dark/Light mode).
