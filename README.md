## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository hosts my personal **Knowledge Base and Engineering Portfolio**. It serves as a centralized hub for validated technical scenarios, focusing on Linux systems, Virtualization, and Cloud Infrastructure.

The content is structured to demonstrate competency in **LFCS (Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin)** domains and real-world DevOps practices.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

This site is built using a modern **Docs-as-Code** approach:

![Markdown](https://img.shields.io/badge/markdown-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=markdown&logoColor=white)
![GitLab CI](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitlab%20ci-%23181717.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitlab&logoColor=white)
![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)

*   **Engine:** [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) (SSG) for high performance and accessibility.
*   **Content:** Written in **MDX** (Markdown + Components), migrated and curated from a private Obsidian PKM vault.
*   **Deploy:** Automated builds via **GitLab CI/CD** to GitLab Pages.
*   **Styling:** Custom CSS variables adapting to system color schemes (Dark/Light mode).
