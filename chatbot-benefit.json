  "question": {
    "scenario": "A company employs a team of customer service agents to provide telephone and email support to customers. The company develops a webchat bot to provide automated answers to common customer queries.",
    "prompt": "Which business benefit should the company expect as a result of creating the webchat bot solution?"
  },
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "A",
      "text": "increased sales"
    },
    {
      "id": "B",
      "text": "a reduced workload for the customer service agents"
    },
    {
      "id": "C",
      "text": "improved product reliability"
    }
  ],
  "correctAnswerId": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "summary": "The primary and most direct benefit is reducing the workload of human agents, as the chatbot automates responses to frequently asked questions, allowing the team to focus on more complex issues.",
    "breakdown": [
      {
        "optionId": "A",
        "reasoning": "Increased sales is a possible secondary benefit, but not the primary goal of the scenario, which focuses on support."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "B",
        "reasoning": "Correct. Automating common queries directly frees up agents, fulfilling a key objective of operational efficiency."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "C",
        "reasoning": "The chatbot is a customer support tool, not a product development tool. It has no direct impact on the product's reliability."
      }
